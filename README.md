# cryptopals

This project holds my solutions to the cryptography exercises at https://cryptopals.com/. I plan on updating this repo as I find the time to complete new challenges (or until I get stuck). The code is meant to be run with **cargo test** and requires **Rust**.

## Install Rust
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

## Run Tests
`cargo test` from the project root directory.
